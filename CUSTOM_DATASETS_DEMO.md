# Custom Datasets Feature - User Guide

## 🎉 **Custom Dataset Creation is Now Available!**

The custom dataset feature has been successfully integrated into your Go training app. Here's how users can create and manage custom datasets:

## 📱 **How to Create Custom Datasets**

### 1. **Access the Settings Screen**
- Open the app and tap the **Settings** (⚙️) icon in the top-right corner
- You'll see the enhanced Dataset Selection section

### 2. **Create a Custom Dataset**
- In the Dataset Selection section, you'll see different base dataset types:
  - **9x9 Final Positions**
  - **19x19 Final Positions**
  - **19x19 Midgame Estimation**
  - **9x9 Final Variations**
  - **Partial Area Analysis**

- Each base type has a **"+"** button next to it
- Tap the **"+"** button for the base type you want to customize

### 3. **Configure Your Custom Dataset**
- A dialog will open asking for:
  - **Base Dataset Type** (pre-selected based on which + button you clicked)
  - **Dataset Name** (give it a meaningful name like "Quick 9x9 Practice" or "Competition 19x19")

- Tap **"Create Dataset"**

### 4. **Customize Settings**
- After creation, your new custom dataset will be automatically selected
- The **Dataset Settings** section will show configuration options for your custom dataset:
  - **Button Type** (Winner prediction, Rough lead, Exact score)
  - **Time per Problem**
  - **Position Type** (for final datasets)
  - **Ownership Display Mode**
  - And many more options!

- All changes are **saved automatically**

### 5. **Manage Custom Datasets**
- **View**: All your custom datasets appear under their respective base types
- **Select**: Tap any dataset to switch to it
- **Edit**: Use the **⋮** menu on custom datasets to edit name or delete
- **Track Performance**: Statistics are tracked separately for each custom dataset

## 💡 **Example Use Cases**

### Scenario 1: "Different Time Constraints"
- Create "Quick 9x9" (10 seconds per problem) for rapid practice
- Create "Slow 9x9" (30 seconds per problem) for careful analysis
- Both based on the same 9x9 Final Positions base type

### Scenario 2: "Different Prediction Types"
- Create "Winner Only" with Winner prediction buttons
- Create "Score Practice" with Exact score prediction
- Both using 19x19 Final Positions as base

### Scenario 3: "Tournament Preparation"
- Create "Tournament Settings" matching your tournament conditions
- Create "Analysis Mode" with ownership display enabled for learning

## 🔍 **What's Under the Hood**

### Technical Features:
- ✅ **5 Base Dataset Types** to choose from
- ✅ **Unlimited Custom Datasets** per base type
- ✅ **Individual Configuration** - each custom dataset has its own settings
- ✅ **Performance Tracking** - statistics tracked separately for each custom dataset
